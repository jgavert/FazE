Name depicts that the projects goal isn't clear, hence its referencing mist.
It's a collection of libraries to fasten researching or prototyping of multithreaded and/or advanced graphics algorithms.

### Current situation:
Works on Win10, doesn't compile on linux.
Vulkan isn't up-to-par with dx12.
Api isn't finalized, need to work on multiple devices and queues.
Also some alternate designs needed for api, might be better to do some things up front.

Building isn't trivial, but as this is personal project, I will not spend time improving that situation much. Basically you need to do some things with external projects that the build expects to be around.
I'm sure if you are motivated, you can figure them out.
